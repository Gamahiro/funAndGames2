## About
Food truck game made with a fully dynamic dom using vanilla JS
itemList.json contains all the game items that are being constructed into new game objects

# Planned

## Graphics:
Icons, customers, trucks etc..

## Trucks and Truck Shop:
The game will have trucks that will be used to determine an inventory size.
This might also determine Cooking Speed and other future features.

## Saving and loading:
The page will probably use localStorage to save/load gamedata such as money, inventory, trucks etc.
Will have to create functions to set the data into a new object using a 'saveData' constructor.

## Customer Orders:
Customers will appear in the gameWindow element placing an order which the player has to cook.
The challenge for the player will be that they won't be able to see the recipe on the cooking screen.

## Landing page/main page
If no saveData is found, create landing page
Add a main page to display playerdata/statistics
